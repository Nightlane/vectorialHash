# vectorialIndex
Some algorithms of my invention. The algorithms in this project are about index and hash techniques designed to work with elements in vectorial spaces. Always taking into consideration optimizations for the current computer architecture model.

Theory published.

Comming soon:
* translation to Spanish
* a line algorithm compatible with the tree data structure
* a code working example
